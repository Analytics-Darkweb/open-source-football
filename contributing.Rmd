The key idea of Open Source Football is to make football related analysis and
the corresponding code publicly available. To achieve this we need volunteers 
who are willing to make a contribution.

Articles posted on Open Source Football are authored using [Distill for R 
Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill). This guide is intended to help all 
contributors to get their articles ready for publishing. 

## Step by Step Overview

If you are willing to contribute you will have to follow the below steps (we will
discuss some steps more detailed below):

1. Install the R packages you will need to contribute
1. Create a copy of the website repo to your GitHub
1. Load it into a new R Studio project and start working in a new branch
1. Create the new article (see [the 
repo](https://github.com/mrcaseb/open-source-football/tree/master/_posts) for 
some examples) and don't forget to check the [Distill for R 
Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill) website.
1. Commit all to your post related files and push them into the new branch in 
your GitHub repo
1. Visit your repo and create a pull request to merge your post into the 
open-source-football repo

With the last step we will be notified and will take a look at your article, 
suggest changes as necessary, then publish it when itâ€™s ready by merging it into
the main repo.

## More Detailed Instruction

1. Install the packages `distill` and `rmarkdown` with

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("distill", "rmarkdown"))
```

2. Login to your GitHub account, view the 
[website repo](https://github.com/mrcaseb/open-source-football) and fork it by
clicking the "Fork" button. The current version of the repo will be copied into
your GitHub.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38586519/90563320-ed936480-e1a3-11ea-90b0-9fbc00a6808b.png")
```

Create a new branch within your repo and try to choose a descriptive name

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38586519/90564133-24b64580-e1a5-11ea-91cc-5e34224f63d5.png")
```

3. Copy the web url of the new repo into your clipboard

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38586519/90564521-cccc0e80-e1a5-11ea-8fd7-493f40b74cd3.png")
```

In RStudio choose "Create a Project" > "Version Control" > "Git", paste the
Repository URL from step 4 and click "Create Project". The whole thing will be
downloaded and the project opened. 

Important: Make sure you switch into your newly created branch from step 2

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38586519/90626505-57028a00-e21b-11ea-847d-621083af7771.png")
```

4. Create the new article by running

```{r, eval=FALSE}
distill::create_post("Title of your post")
```

This will create a new folder in `_posts` and name it with the current date and
your chosen title. Additionally the RMarkdown file in which you will write your 
post will be opened automatically.
